# My Boring Portfolio

This is just a simple static site porfolio I built with NextJS. The design is heavily influenced by [nexxel.dev](https://www.nexxel.dev), really a fan of the simple sleek design. Somewhat new to Next but I feel as if im getting a grip of it now.
This site provides some info on me, showcases some of my projects, and is the platform on which I post my blogs [(here)](https://www.leomosley.com/blog).

The projects showcased are simply just the GitHub repos which I have given the topic `showcase` - they're fetched using the GitHub api.

I store my blog pages in the [blog](blog) directory and use [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) to parse the content and heading information.
